# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java - Lesson 1

This is my first lesson in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Java. The code demonstrates basic OOP concepts such as **classes**, **objects**, **instance variables**, **methods**, and **encapsulation**.

## Project Overview

This project contains two simple classes, `Pen` and `Student`, representing objects with attributes and methods. The goal is to understand how to define classes, create objects from those classes, and implement methods to manipulate or display object data.

### Key OOP Concepts Covered:
1. **Classes and Objects**
2. **Instance Variables (Attributes)**
3. **Methods (Functions inside a class)**
4. **Encapsulation (Using `this` keyword)**
5. **Object Initialization**
6. **Method Overloading (Optional)**

## Code Structure

The project contains three main classes:
1. **Pen**: A class that represents a pen with attributes such as color and type.
2. **Student**: A class that represents a student with attributes such as name and age.
3. **Index**: The entry point of the program containing the `main` method where objects of `Pen` and `Student` are created and their methods are called.
